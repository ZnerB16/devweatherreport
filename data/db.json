For the past 3 months, I was bouncing around learning new skills from data to development hoping that I'd finally get a job at something, it didn't have to be data, nor development, I just wanted to feel like a professional after graduating. I'm just really frustrated and envious that all of my college classmates and friends have found data-related jobs and are thriving. As for me, I'm slowly succumbing to my own thoughts in existential crisis. "
